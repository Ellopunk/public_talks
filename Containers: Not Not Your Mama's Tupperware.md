# Containers: Not Your Mama's Tupperware

   I must admit, I almost stopped myself from using Containers: Not Your Mama's Tupperware as the title of this article for fear of not being seen as professional or perhaps being perceived as not knowing the subject. But, if I am going to be honest with you, the more questions I have asked about containers the more I have started to think that what we really need is a non-professional, non-technical, real-world way of looking at containers.
     As Linux administrators, Linux containers are something we use without ever thinking about the technology behind them. How they work is never a question that we stop to think about; all we really care about is that they do work when we need them. 
     Then came the day when I was asked to help explain Kubernetes. Simple right? Container orchestration, except this time I had an audience who greeted that answer with a blank stare. So my next answer was, “Well, it helps organize your Docker containers across your environment.” This was followed by the next logical question: “But what’s a Docker container?” I answered the way no one ever should, “Well, you know, Linux containers.” I had violated one of the basic rules of technology: never assume what someone knows. The technology sector is so vast that no one knows everything and if they claim they do, it just means they have not been tackling anything new recently. 
     So I started to asked others to explain these concepts to me and their answers pretty much lined up with mine. I realized that I might not be the only one who couldn’t really explain, without using overly technical jargon, and if we can’t  explain it maybe we don’t know it as well as we think we do. So I started this journey just like I was taught in elementary school: in order to understand something you must know the who, what, when, where and why? 
	
*Who:* Containers. Alright, since we are talking about technology, I’m going to take some 
creative liberties here as containers might technically be considered a “what” instead of a “who”. 
 When I think about containers, I think about tupperware. Actually, I think of the cheap, store-bought version of tupperware that you just throw away when you are done. Turns out that when it comes to Linux containers, this definition is not to far off the mark. 

*What:* Linux containers are a method of operating system virtualization, but what does that even mean? Well, Linux containers might have more in common with your mama’s tupperware  than we originally thought. Think about it; if we want to share a meal with someone what’s easier? Packing up a grocery bag full of groceries, where we include a whole head of lettuce, entire jars of spices, and a set of instructions? Then, we hope they have the right kitchen tools to put it all together?  Or, do we plan ahead measuring ingredients and putting the final product together before we ship it off to them, all ready to be enjoyed? 
     When we want to send our application from development to production we don’t want to have to spend the time building out a whole new environment when someone's already done the work once. Containers allow us to just put the files that our application needs into our virtual tupperware and ship them off ready for use.  

*When:* This question was actually the one I enjoyed the most in my journey because I was able to take a journey back in time, the journey went a bit like this.
1.	Where are we now? The industry is all a buzz about Kubernetes but what is Kubernetes?  Container orchestration that helps large scale deployments and helps developers and operators to build apps with products like Docker.
2.	What is Docker? Since its release in March of 2013  Docker has helped companies break free from the constraints of existing infrastructure by allowing them to containerize their applications.
3.	What is a container? A container is a lightweight, stand alone environment used for executable packages for our applications. However this really is not a new concept as we can see the first steps towards this isolation in 1979 with the development of the chroot command. 
 
 *Where:*  We could be running Linux containers to debug provisioning scripts. We could use LXD, which is an open source container management extension of Linux containers, in our data center as part of our OpenStack deployment. Or, we could have a full Kubernetes deployment, running across multiple Raspberry Pis, sitting on a shelf above our desks. That’s the great part about containers: the “where” is really only limited by our imaginations.

*Why:* Containers allow us to build our applications and ship them off, containing only the files needed and none of the extra baggage. Containers also allow us to create isolation in order to make the best use of our environments.  After all, you wouldn’t send off a salad and a soup in the same container would you?
